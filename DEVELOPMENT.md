# Development Log

## Week 2 - Thursday
- Project proposed: Jones polynomial calculator
- Initial repository structure created
- Researching Kauffman bracket algorithm
- Setting up C++ development environment

## Thursday Evening - Week 2
- Implemented Laurent polynomial class
- Basic arithmetic operations working (addition, multiplication)
- Next: Need to represent knots and implement Kauffman bracket

### Technical Notes
- Using std::map for sparse polynomial storage
- Powers can be negative (Laurent polynomials)

### Next Steps
- Implement basic polynomial class
- Implement knot representation
- Get basic algorithm working for trefoil knot
- Add test cases with known results
